/**
 * LocomotionComponent
 *
 * DEPRECATION: This monolithic component is being migrated to granular
 * MovementLimits + per-behavior steering components (WanderSteering,
 * ArriveSteering, BoundaryAvoidance, AlignSteering). It remains for
 * backward compatibility during the transition.
 *
 * Canonical, per-entity movement/steering parameters used by all behaviors
 * (Seek/Arrive, Wander, Align). These parameters persist across behavior mode
 * switches; only Behaviour.mode/state changes at runtime.
 *
 * Conventions
 * - Positions are in pixels.
 * - Linear speeds are in pixels/second; accelerations in pixels/second^2.
 * - Angles are radians; angular speeds in radians/second; angular accelerations in radians/second^2.
 * - Time constants are in seconds.
 *
 * References
 * - AI for Games (3rd ed.), ch. 3.2: Seek/Arrive, Wander, Align.
